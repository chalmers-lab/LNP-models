# LNP-models

mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) effectively deliver mRNA into cells. However, the physical structure of these particles under acidic and physiological pHs remain poorly understood. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations and small-angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) to investigate LNP structure. We modelled LNPs with varying water content and the placement of PEGylated lipids using Martini coarse-grained force field. New Martini parameters were developed for the lipids MC3, IMC and PEGylated lipid. LNP systems were modelled at pH 4 and 7.4. At pH 4, the simulations suggest the formation of bilayers at the aqueous interface of the LNPs, with a largely amorphous core, whereas at pH 7.4, the morphology is entirely amorphous. Based on our models, we estimate that LNPs contain less than 1% w/w water, with the RNAs residing at the interface between water clusters and lipids. We find that RNA entrapment is enhanced when water clusters form inside LNPs. SAXS experiments were also conducted on LNPs at the two pH values using the same lipids. We found that the MD simulations correlate well with SAXS data. This study provides insight into water cluster formation, lipid arrangement, and RNA distribution inside LNPs, advancing our understanding of mRNA-LNP formulations.
